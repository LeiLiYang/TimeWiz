# TimeWiz

TimeWiz is a versatile application developed using Python, Flask, React, Google API, and OpenAI API. Its primary purpose is to serve as a personal chatbot assistant, allowing users to interact with their calendars effortlessly. The key functionalities include scheduling events and answering questions related to scheduled events in response to a short user prompt. Additionally, TimeWiz integrates with Gmail, enabling users to send AI-drafted emails directly from the application by providing a short description of the email.

Developed project as a team of 4 for McGill AI Society Hackathon 2023.
